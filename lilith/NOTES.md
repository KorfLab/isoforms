# Sequence Bias Experiments

## Setup

### Data

A useful dataset requires the following:

- introns from genes with at least 2 introns
- internal exons of a size at least twice the desired window size for junction meter training
- source data consisting of only protein coding genes (mRNA-producing)


All data was obtained from release WS297 from WormBase
